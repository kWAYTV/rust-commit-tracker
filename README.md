## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release** for your operating system:

   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/kWAYTV/rust-commit-tracker/releases)
   - Download the appropriate archive for your OS:
     - `rust-commit-tracker-vX.X.X-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip` (Windows)
     - `rust-commit-tracker-vX.X.X-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` (Linux)
     - `rust-commit-tracker-vX.X.X-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` (macOS)

2. **Extract and run**:
   ```bash
   # Extract the archive
   # On first run, it will create config.toml
   ./rust-commit-tracker
   ```

### Option 2: Build from Source

Requirements: [Rust 1.70+](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kWAYTV/rust-commit-tracker.git
cd rust-commit-tracker
cargo build --release
./target/release/rust-commit-tracker
```

### Option 3: Install via Cargo

```bash
cargo install rust-commit-tracker
rust-commit-tracker
```

## Configuration

On first run, the application creates `config.toml`. **Only the Discord webhook URL is required** - all other settings have sensible defaults.

### Required Configuration

Edit `config.toml` and set your Discord webhook URL:

```toml
[discord]
webhook_url = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"  # ‚Üê Only required field
```

### Full Configuration Reference

```toml
[discord]
webhook_url = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"  # Required: Your Discord webhook
bot_name = "Rust Commit Tracker"          # Optional: Bot display name
bot_avatar_url = "https://i.imgur.com/on47Qk9.png"  # Optional: Bot avatar

[monitoring]
commits_url = "https://commits.facepunch.com/?format=json"  # API endpoint
check_interval_secs = 50  # How often to check for new commits

[appearance]
embed_color = "#CD412B"  # Rust orange color for Discord embeds
footer_icon_url = "https://i.imgur.com/on47Qk9.png"

[database]
url = "sqlite:commits.db"  # SQLite database location
cleanup_keep_last = 1000   # Number of commits to retain in database
```

## Getting a Discord Webhook URL

1. Open your Discord server settings
2. Go to **Integrations** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

4. Choose the channel and copy the webhook URL

- Send notifications for new commits to your Discord channel
- Maintain a local database to prevent duplicate notifications
- Automatically resume from the last processed commit after restarts
